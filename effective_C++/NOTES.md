# notes

## 1. View C++ as a federation of languages.

* C: blocks, statements, preprocessor, built-in data types, arrays, pointers.
* Object-Oriented C++: classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual function(dynamic binding)
* Templete C++
* STL

pass-by-value: C-like data types, STL;
pass-by-reference: Object-Oriented C++, user-defined constructor/deconstructor, templete C++;

## 2. Prefer const, enum, inlines to #define
